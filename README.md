# Properties-Of-Numbers

This repository contains python scripts all about properties of numbers!
  + evens_odds.py: This script contains functions that determine whether real numbers and their sums and products are even, odd, or neither (for non-integers).
  + sign.py: This script contains functions that determine the sign of given real numbers, their sums, and their products. 
  + numbers_activity: This script takes numbers inputted by the user and applies the functions in the above scripts to help the user discover rules (eg: the product of two negative numbers is a positive number). The activity concludes with an assessment and the user's responses are stored in a file.
