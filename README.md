# Properties-Of-Numbers :1234: :hash:

This repository contains python and R scripts for functions and interactive lessons/activities all about properties of numbers! Please note that the python scripts were completed in Python 2.7.8 and require Python 2 to run.

 ## Evens & Odds
 
These scripts contain functions that determine whether real numbers and their sums and products are even, odd, or neither (for non-integers):
+ evens_odds.py: <font: color = "green">:snake: script </font>
+ is_even.R: <font: color = "blue"> **R** script </font>

## signs.py :negative_squared_cross_mark: 
 
This script contains functions to return the signs of numbers, the product of two numbers, and the signs of the products. These fucntions are applied to an interactive lesson. In the lesson, the user inputs real numbers of their choice and the script applies the functions to generate all combinations of pairs of the numbers, the signs of the two numbers in the pair, the product of the two numbers, and the sign of the product. At the end of the lesson, there is an assessment, and the user's responses are stored in the user-specified input file. 
 
 ## stats.py

This script contains functions to determine the stats of a sample- the average, the median, the min, the max, the range, and skewedness- and applies these functions to an interactive lesson. In the lesson, 50 random integers between 1 and 100 are generated, the functions are applied to get the stats of the sample, and the results are printed. This process is repeated 5 times to generate 5 total samples so that the user can discover the meaning of the stats. At the end of the lesson, there is an assessment. The assessment is graded and the user gets three attempts for each question. The user's score is printed out and the responses are stored in the user-specified input file.
